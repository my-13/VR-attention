## Tony's Thoughts

If I made this again, I don't think I would make it again.
About 8/10 weeks in, I viewed it more as a platform that people could develop, than a single trial, but it was too late 
A lot of the code is so incredibly opinionated that I wouldn't consider this a platform, more a single-use case

There's so many repetive variables that should just not be used.
The way Unity handles files is actually a crime.
